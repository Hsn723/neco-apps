## accurate

Check [releases](https://github.com/cybozu-go/accurate/releases) for changes.

Update the manifest as follows:

```console
$ make update-accurate
$ git diff
```

## argocd

1. Check [releases](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases) for changes.
2. Check [upgrading overview](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/docs/operator-manual/upgrading/overview.md) when upgrading major or minor version.
3. Run the following command and check the diff.

   ```console
   $ make update-argocd
   $ git diff
   ```

4. Update `KUSTOMIZE_VERSION` in `test/Makefile`.

## bmc-reverse-proxy

Update image tags as follows,

```console
$ make update-bmc-reverse-proxy
$ git diff
```

## cadvisor

1. Check the [release page](https://github.com/google/cadvisor/releases) for changes.
2. Run the following commands to update the manifests and to check the diff.
   ```console
   $ make update-cadvisor
   $ git diff
   ```

## cert-manager

Check [the upgrading section](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/) in the official website.

```console
$ make update-cert-manager
$ git diff
```

## customer-egress (Squid and unbound)

customer-egress contains Squid and unbound containers.

Update the manifests as follows:

```console
$ make update-customer-egress
$ git diff
```

## elastic (ECK)

Check the [Release Notes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/eck-release-notes.html) and [Upgrade ECK](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-upgrading-eck.html) on the official website.

Update the upstream manifests as follows:

```console
$ make update-eck
$ git diff
```

Check the difference, and adjust our patches to the new manifests.

## external-dns

Read the following document and fix manifests as necessary.

https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/vX.Y.Z/docs/tutorials/coredns.md

Update the manifests as follows:

```console
$ make update-external-dns
$ git diff
```

## kube-metrics-adapter

Check [releases](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kube-metrics-adapter/releases).

Update the manifests as follows:

```console
$ make setup   # install/updaet Helm; if a newer Helm is required, update HELM_VERSION in Makefile first
$ make update-kube-metrics-adapter
$ git diff kube-metrics-adapter
```

## kube-storage-version-migrator

1. Check the [release page](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-storage-version-migrator/releases) for changes.
2. Run the following commands to update the manifests and to check the diff.

## ingress (Contour & Envoy)

Check the [upgrading guide](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/) in the official website.

Check diffs of projectcontour/contour files as follows:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/projectcontour/contour
$ cd contour
$ git checkout vX.Y.Z
$ git diff vA.B.C...vX.Y.Z examples/contour
```

Then, import YAML manifests as follows:

```console
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cybozu-go/neco-apps
$ rm ./ingress/base/contour/*
$ cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/projectcontour/contour/examples/contour/*.yaml ./ingress/base/contour/
```

Check diffs of contour and envoy deployments as follows:

```console
$ diff -u ingress/base/contour/03-contour.yaml ingress/base/template/deployment-contour.yaml
$ diff -u ingress/base/contour/03-envoy.yaml ingress/base/template/deployment-envoy.yaml
```

Note that:
- We do not use contour's certificate issuance feature, but use cert-manager to issue certificates required for gRPC.
- We change Envoy manifest from DaemonSet to Deployment.
  - We replace or add probes with our custom one bundled in our Envoy container image.
- Not all manifests inherit the upstream. Please check `kustomization.yaml` which manifest inherits or not.
  - If the manifest in the upstream is usable as is, use it from `ingress/base/kustomization.yaml`.
  - If the manifest needs modification:
    - If the manifest is for a cluster-wide resource, put a modified version in the `common` directory.
    - If the manifest is for a namespaced resource, put a template in the `template` directory and apply patches.

## local-pv-provisioner

Update image tags as follows,

```console
$ make update-local-pv-provisioner
$ git diff
```

## logging

### loki, loki-canary

Check [loki releases](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases).

Check installation document for [loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/installation/tanka/) and [loki-canary](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/operations/loki-canary/).
If install procedures for loki or loki-canary are updated, update Makefile accordingly.

Check [k8s-alpha](https://github.com/jsonnet-libs/k8s-alpha/) jsonnet library to find the appropriate value for `JSONNET_LIBS_K8S_ALPHA_VERSION` in Makefile.
If the library supports the currently used Kubernetes version, i.e. if the repository contains a directory with the name of the current Kubernetes version, then use that version as the value.
If not, use the latest Kubernetes version that the library supports.
In both cases, update `JSONNET_LIBS_K8S_ALPHA_VERSION` in Makefile if necessary.

Update the manifests as follows:

```console
$ make setup   # install/update Tanka and jsonnet-builder; if a newer Tanka is required, update TANKA_VERSION in Makefile first
$ make update-logging-loki
$ git diff logging
```

### promtail

Promtail is an agent for Loki.
It is published in Loki repository.
Check [loki releases](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases) for the changes of Promtail.

There is no official kubernetes manifests for promtail.
Generate manifests from the Helm charts and check the changes as follows.

```
LOGGING_DIR=$GOPATH/src/github.com/cybozu-go/neco-apps/logging
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm search repo -l grafana | grep grafana/promtail
# Example output with a header line:
#   NAME                            CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
#   grafana/promtail                3.5.1           2.2.1           Promtail is an agent which ships the contents o...
#   grafana/promtail                3.5.0           2.2.0           Promtail is an agent which ships the contents o...

# Choose the latest `CHART VERSION` which matches the target Loki's `APP VERSION` and set the value like below.
PROMTAIL_CHART_VERSION=X.Y.Z
helm template logging --namespace=logging grafana/promtail --version=${PROMTAIL_CHART_VERSION} > ${LOGGING_DIR}/base/promtail/upstream/promtail.yaml
cd ${LOGGING_DIR}
git diff
```

Check the difference between the existing manifest and the new manifest, and update the kustomization patch.

In upstream, loki and promtail settings are stored in secret resource. The configuration is now written in configmap, so decode the secret and compare the settings.

```console
$ yq eval '.stringData."promtail.yaml" | select(.)' logging/base/promtail/upstream/promtail.yaml > /tmp/promtail.yaml
$ diff -u logging/base/promtail/config/promtail.yaml /tmp/promtail.yaml

# diff of .client.url is intentional
```

Update the image tag as follows.

```console
$ make update-logging-promtail
$ git diff
```

## machines-endpoints
